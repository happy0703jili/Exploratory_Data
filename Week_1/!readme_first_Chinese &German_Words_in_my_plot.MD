Chinese Words and German word in my plot!

Hello my classmates!

In the "Plot2", "Plot3" and "Plot4",  there are the Chinese words under
the x-axis, the "周四" is "Thursday" or “Thu.", the "周五" is "Friday" or "Fri.", and the "周六" is "Saturday" or "Sat.".

Because the system language of my PC is Chinese， therefore, when I
create these plots, it were automatically labeled with Chinese.

I have try the computer in my Company, but the system language here is German, so you can some German in Plot2 to Plot4. 
Namely, the "Do" is in fact "Thursday"("Donnerstag in German").
