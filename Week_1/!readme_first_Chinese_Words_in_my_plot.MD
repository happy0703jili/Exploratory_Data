Chinese Words in my plot!

Hello my classmates!

In the "Plot2", "Plot3" and "Plot4",  there are the Chinese words under
the x-axis, the "周四" is "Thursday" or “Thu.", the “周五” is "Friday" or "Fri.", and the “周六” is "Saturday" or "Sat.".

Because the system language of my PC is Chinese， therefore, when I
create these plots, it were automatically labeled with Chinese.
